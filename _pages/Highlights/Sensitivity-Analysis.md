I have been conducting research on sensitivity analysis in nonlinear semidefinite programming (SDP) for over 25 years. My journey began in 1999 with Professor Jie Sun, when we established the [strong semismoothness of the metric projector over the SDP cone]({{ '/files/SS_02.pdf' | relative_url }}). By taking advantage of this property, I solved the long-standing open question of [characterizing Robinson's strong regularity of nonlinear SDP problems]({{ '/files/MOR_NLSDP.pdf' | relative_url }}). Consequently,  [Robinson's strong regularity for linear SDP is proven to be true if and only if the primal nondegeneracy and the dual nondegeneracy hold simutaneously]({{ '/files/CONSTRAINT%20NONDEGENERACYSDP2008.pdf' | relative_url }}). Meanwhile, by using the strong semismoothness  of the metric projector over the SDP cone, together with Professor [Houduo Qi](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/hdqi/hdqi.html), we designed a highly efficient quadratically convergent semismooth Newton method for computing the nearest correlation matrix problem   in [“A quadratically convergent Newton method for computing the nearest correlation matrix”]({{ '/files/A%20QUADRATICALLY%20CONVERGENT%20NEWTON%20METHOD%20FOR_published.pdf' | relative_url }})   (the problem comes from finance and the "NCM" term was initially introduced by late Professor [Nick Higham](https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-news/articles/remembering-nick-higham-1961-2024/)). 
The next milestone is the [characterization of the robust isolated calmness for a class of conic programming problems]({{ '/files/RobustCalm.pdf' | relative_url }}). This line of inquiry culminated in achieving a long-standing goal: demonstrating that the [Aubin property is equivalent to Robinson’s strong regularity at a local optimal solution for nonlinear SDP]({{ '/files/s10107-025-02231-2_published.pdf' | relative_url }}). What follows is [a brief overview of my research in this area]({{ '/files/NLSDP_Aubin_Sensitivity.pdf' | relative_url }}).
