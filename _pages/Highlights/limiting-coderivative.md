The limiting (Mordukhovich) coderivative of the metric projection onto a convex set  S has played a central role in variational analysis, particularly in the study of the Aubin property. However, for non-polyhedral sets S, it was not known whether explicit formulas for these coderivatives could be computed. This situation began to change in 2008, when, together with Professor [Jiri Outrata](https://staff.utia.cas.cz/outrata/),  we successfully derived explicit coderivative formulas for the metric projection onto the second-order cone. Our results were published in    [Jiri Outrata](https://staff.utia.cas.cz/outrata/) and Defeng Sun, [“On the coderivative of the projection operator onto the second order cone”]({{ '/files/CoderivativeOfTheProjectSOC.pdf' | relative_url }}), [**Set-Valued Analysis**](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-8176-4848-0) 16 (2008) 999--1014. These coderivative formulas have since found important applications. For instance, in 2025, [Liang Chen](https://grzy.hnu.edu.cn/site/index/chenliang3), Ruoning Chen, Defeng Sun, and Junyuan Zhu used them in their paper, “[Aubin property and strong regularity are equivalent for nonlinear second-order cone programming]({{ '/files/Aubin_SIOPT.pdf' | relative_url }})”, published in [**SIAM Journal on Optimization**](https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-journals/siam-journal-on-optimization/) 35:2 (2025) 712--738.   In this work, they established the equivalence between the Aubin property and Robinson's strong regularity for nonlinear second-order cone programming.  [See the Flowchart of the Proof]({{ '/files/SOCP_Aubin_StrongRegularity_ProofChart.pdf' | relative_url }}). Further progress was made in 2014, when [Chao Ding](https://www.dingchao.info/), Defeng Sun, and [Jane Ye](http://www.math.uvic.ca/faculty/janeye/) derived explicit formulas for the metric projection onto the cone of symmetric and positive semidefinite matrices—an important non-polyhedral cone in semidefinite programming. Their results appeared in   [“First order optimality conditions for mathematical programs with semidefinite cone complementarity constraints”]({{ '/files/FO_SDPMPCC.pdf' | relative_url }}),  [**Mathematical Programming**](https://link.springer.com/journal/10107) 147 (2014) 539-579.
