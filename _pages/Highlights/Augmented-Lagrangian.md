The paper by [[Xinyuan Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nFG8lEYAAAAJ&hl=en), Defeng Sun, and [Kim Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/), titled ["A Newton-CG augmented Lagrangian method for semidefinite programming"]({{ '/files/NewtonCGAugLag.pdf' | relative_url }}), published in  SIAM Journal on Optimization 20 (2010), pp. 1737--1765],  initiated the research on using the semismooth Newton-CG augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) for solving semidefinite programming (SDP). <a href="{{ '/files/SDPNAL+v1.0.zip' | relative_url }}" download>SDPNAL+</a> is a MATLAB software for solving large scale SDP with bound constraints ([click here for an introduction on how to use the package](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/softwares/sdpnalplus/)). This software was awarded [the triennial  triennial [Beale–Orchard-Hays Prize](https://www.mathopt.org/?nav=boh) for Excellence in Computational Mathematical Programming by the [Mathematical Optimization Society](https://www.mathopt.org/) at Bordeaux, France, July 2-6, 2018.
