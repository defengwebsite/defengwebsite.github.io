In the paper by [Xudong Li](https://www.lixudong.info/), Defeng Sun, and [Kim Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/), titled [“A block symmetric Gauss-Seidel decomposition theorem for convex composite quadratic programming and its applications”]({{ '/files/Li2019_Article_ABlockSymmetricGaussSeidelDeco.pdf' | relative_url }}), published in [Mathematical Programming](https://link.springer.com/journal/10107) 175 (2019) 395--418, we established a symmetric Gauss-Seidel decomposition theorem. This theorem plays a critical role in the successful design of alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMMs) for multi-block convex optimization problems. It is particularly effective when combined with the convergence analysis of the semi-proximal ADMMs for solving linearly constrained convex optimization problems, as developed in Appendix B of the paper by [[Maryam Fazel](https://people.ece.uw.edu/fazel_maryam/), [Ting Kei Pong](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/pong/), Defeng Sun, and [Paul Tseng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tseng), titled "Hankel matrix rank minimization with applications to system identification and realization", [Hankel-Matrix-semi-Proximal-ADMM]({{ '/files/Hankel-Matrix-Semi-proximal-ADMM.pdf' | relative_url }}) published in **SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications** 34 (2013) 946-977.]  Moreover, this decompsoition theorem was used by [Liang Chen](https://grzy.hnu.edu.cn/site/index/chenliang3), [Xudong Li](https://www.lixudong.info/), Defeng Sun, and [Kim Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/) to prove   the equivalence of inexact proximal augmented Lagrangian methods  and ADMMs for a class of convex composite programming. Their results were published in [“On the equivalence of inexact proximal ALM and ADMM for a class of convex composite programming”]({{ '/files/Chen2021_Article_OnTheEquivalenceOfInexactProxi.pdf' | relative_url }}), [**Mathematical Programming**](https://link.springer.com/journal/10107) 185 (2021) 111—161 [[Correction to the Proof of Lemma 3.3]({{ '/files/Equivalence-Erratum-2022.pdf' | relative_url }})].
