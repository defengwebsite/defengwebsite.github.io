<!-- - **Sensitivity Analysis in Nonlinear Semidefinite Programming**: I have been conducting research on sensitivity analysis in nonlinear semidefinite programming (SDP) for over 25 years. My journey began in 1999 with Professor Jie Sun, when we established the [strong semismoothness of the metric projector over the SDP cone]({{ '/files/SS_02.pdf' | relative_url }}). By taking advantage of this property, I solved the long-standing open question of [characterizing Robinson's strong regularity of nonlinear SDP problems]({{ '/files/MOR_NLSDP.pdf' | relative_url }}). Consequently,  [Robinson's strong regularity for linear SDP is proven to be true if and only if the primal nondegeneracy and the dual nondegeneracy hold simutaneously]({{ '/files/CONSTRAINT%20NONDEGENERACYSDP2008.pdf' | relative_url }}). Meanwhile, by using the strong semismoothness  of the metric projector over the SDP cone, together with Professor [Houduo Qi](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/hdqi/hdqi.html), we designed a highly efficient quadratically convergent semismooth Newton method for computing the nearest correlation matrix problem   in [“A quadratically convergent Newton method for computing the nearest correlation matrix”]({{ '/files/A%20QUADRATICALLY%20CONVERGENT%20NEWTON%20METHOD%20FOR_published.pdf' | relative_url }})   (the problem comes from finance and the "NCM" term was initially introduced by late Professor [Nick Higham](https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-news/articles/remembering-nick-higham-1961-2024/)). 
The next milestone is the [characterization of the robust isolated calmness for a class of conic programming problems]({{ '/files/RobustCalm.pdf' | relative_url }}). This line of inquiry culminated in achieving a long-standing goal: demonstrating that the [Aubin property is equivalent to Robinson’s strong regularity at a local optimal solution for nonlinear SDP]({{ '/files/s10107-025-02231-2_published.pdf' | relative_url }}). What follows is [a brief overview of my research in this area]({{ '/files/NLSDP_Aubin_Sensitivity.pdf' | relative_url }}).



- **Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Solving Composite Conic Programming**:  The paper by [[Xinyuan Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nFG8lEYAAAAJ&hl=en), Defeng Sun, and [Kim Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/), titled ["A Newton-CG augmented Lagrangian method for semidefinite programming"]({{ '/files/NewtonCGAugLag.pdf' | relative_url }}), published in  SIAM Journal on Optimization 20 (2010), pp. 1737--1765],  initiated the research on using the semismooth Newton-CG augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) for solving semidefinite programming (SDP). <a href="{{ '/files/SDPNAL+v1.0.zip' | relative_url }}" download>SDPNAL+</a> is a MATLAB software for solving large scale SDP with bound constraints ([click here for an introduction on how to use the package](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/softwares/sdpnalplus/)).

- **Smoothing Newton Methods with Global and Local Superlinear Convergence**: In a series of papers—specifically, [Xiaojun Chen](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/staff/xjchen/ChenXJ.htm), Liqun Qi and Defeng Sun, “[**Global and superlinear convergence of the smoothing Newton method and its application to general box constrained variational inequalities**]({{ '/files/CQS_98.pdf' | relative_url }})", Mathematics of Computation, 67 (1998), pp. 519-540,  Liqun Qi, Defeng Sun and Guanglu Zhou, “[**A new look at smoothing Newton methods for nonlinear complementarity problems and box constrained variational inequalities**]({{ '/files/QSZ_00.pdf' | relative_url }})", Mathematical Programming, 87 (2000), 1–35, and Defeng Sun, “[**A regularization Newton method for solving nonlinear complementarity problems**]({{ '/files/AMO_99.pdf' | relative_url }})", Applied Mathematics and Optimization, 40 (1999), 315-339—we have developed globally convergent smoothing Newton methods that achieve local superlinear (or quadratic) convergence for solving semismooth equations under mild conditions. These methods extend the classical Newton methods for smooth equations to a broader class of problems. 

- **Computations of the limiting (Mordukhovich) coderivative of the metric projection onto non-polyhedral convexs sets**: The limiting (Mordukhovich) coderivative of the metric projection onto a 
convex set  S has played a central role in variational analysis, particularly in the study of the Aubin property. However, for non-polyhedral sets S, it was not known whether explicit formulas for these coderivatives could be computed. This situation began to change in 2008, when, together with Professor [Jiri Outrata](https://staff.utia.cas.cz/outrata/),  we successfully derived explicit coderivative formulas for the metric projection onto the second-order cone. Our results were published in    [Jiri Outrata](https://staff.utia.cas.cz/outrata/) and Defeng Sun, [“On the coderivative of the projection operator onto the second order cone”]({{ '/files/CoderivativeOfTheProjectSOC.pdf' | relative_url }}), [**Set-Valued Analysis**](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-8176-4848-0) 16 (2008) 999--1014. These coderivative formulas have since found important applications. For instance, in 2025, [Liang Chen](https://grzy.hnu.edu.cn/site/index/chenliang3), Ruoning Chen, Defeng Sun, and Junyuan Zhu used them in their paper, “[Aubin property and strong regularity are equivalent for nonlinear second-order cone programming]({{ '/files/Aubin_SIOPT.pdf' | relative_url }})”, published in [**SIAM Journal on Optimization**](https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-journals/siam-journal-on-optimization/) 35:2 (2025) 712--738.   In this work, they established the equivalence between the Aubin property and Robinson's strong regularity for nonlinear second-order cone programming.  [See the Flowchart of the Proof]({{ '/files/SOCP_Aubin_StrongRegularity_ProofChart.pdf' | relative_url }}). Further progress was made in 2014, when [Chao Ding](https://www.dingchao.info/), Defeng Sun, and [Jane Ye](http://www.math.uvic.ca/faculty/janeye/) derived explicit formulas for the metric projection onto the cone of symmetric and positive semidefinite matrices—an important non-polyhedral cone in semidefinite programming. Their results appeared in   [“First order optimality conditions for mathematical programs with semidefinite cone complementarity constraints”]({{ '/files/FO_SDPMPCC.pdf' | relative_url }}),  [**Mathematical Programming**](https://link.springer.com/journal/10107) 147 (2014) 539-579.  


- **Second Order Methods for Solving Lasso Problems and Their Extensions**: In statistics and machine learning, lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; also Lasso, LASSO or L1 regularization), a term coined by Professor 
[Robert Tibshirani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tibshirani) in 1996,  [is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the resulting statistical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)).  Most of the popular existing packages for solving lasso problems  are  based on first-order methods such as the block coordinate descent methods and proximal gradient methods.  In order to get fast convergent algorithms with accurate solutions,   from 2018 we started to  develop second-order based semismooth Newton methods  for solving  lasso problems and their extensions. See [Xudong Li](https://www.lixudong.info/), Defeng Sun, and [Kim Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/), [“A highly efficient semismooth Newton augmented Lagrangian method for solving Lasso problems’’]({{ '/files/LassoNalPublished2018.pdf' | relative_url }}), [**SIAM Journal on Optimization**](https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-journals/siam-journal-on-optimization/) 28 (2018) 433--458.

- **A Restricted Wolfe Dual for Convex Quadratic Programming**: It has long been established that [a linear program (LP) has a precise dual form, which is another LP, enabling the derivation of a perfect duality theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_linear_program). However, the situation is more complex for convex quadratic programming (QP)  when the Hessian of the quadratic objective function is neither zero nor positive definite. [In 1961, Philip Wolfe introduced a dual form, known as the Wolfe dual problem, for nonlinear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfe_duality). For a convex QP, the Wolfe dual problem is another convex QP whose solution set, if nonempty, is always unbounded unless the Hessian of the quadratic objective function is positive definite. This presents significant challenges in designing efficient algorithms for solving large-scale convex QPs. In 2018, together with [Xudong Li](https://www.lixudong.info/) and [Kim Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/), we successfully addressed this issue by introducing [a restricted Wolfe dual form for convex composite  QPs]({{ '/files/Li_et_al-2018-Mathematical_Programming_Computation.pdf' | relative_url }}). This restricted Wolfe dual eliminates the ambiguity caused by the rank deficiency of the Hessian of the objective function. It possesses many desirable theoretical properties that resemble those of linear conic programming and facilitates the design of efficient dual-based methods, such as the augmented Lagrangian methods, with guaranteed convergence, for solving convex composite QPs. See "[**my talk slides on the Restricted Wolfe Dual and the Symmetric Gauss-Seidel Decomposition Theorem**]({{ '/files/ConQP_June28_2020.pdf' | relative_url }})".
 

- **A Symmetric Gauss-Seidel Decomposition Theorem for Convex Composite Quadratic Functions**: In the paper by [Xudong Li](https://www.lixudong.info/), Defeng Sun, and [Kim Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/), titled [“A block symmetric Gauss-Seidel decomposition theorem for convex composite quadratic programming and its applications”]({{ '/files/Li2019_Article_ABlockSymmetricGaussSeidelDeco.pdf' | relative_url }}), published in [Mathematical Programming](https://link.springer.com/journal/10107) 175 (2019) 395--418, we established a symmetric Gauss-Seidel decomposition theorem. This theorem plays a critical role in the successful design of alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMMs) for multi-block convex optimization problems. It is particularly effective when combined with the convergence analysis of the semi-proximal ADMMs for solving linearly constrained convex optimization problems, as developed in Appendix B of the paper by [[Maryam Fazel](https://people.ece.uw.edu/fazel_maryam/), [Ting Kei Pong](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/pong/), Defeng Sun, and [Paul Tseng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tseng), titled "Hankel matrix rank minimization with applications to system identification and realization", [Hankel-Matrix-semi-Proximal-ADMM]({{ '/files/Hankel-Matrix-Semi-proximal-ADMM.pdf' | relative_url }}) published in **SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications** 34 (2013) 946-977.]  Moreover, this decompsoition theorem was used by [Liang Chen](https://grzy.hnu.edu.cn/site/index/chenliang3), [Xudong Li](https://www.lixudong.info/), Defeng Sun, and [Kim Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/) to prove   the equivalence of inexact proximal augmented Lagrangian methods  and ADMMs for a class of convex composite programming.
